#Story Blockz

Story Blockz was developed to support the task of creating outlines for movie scripts. 

Story Blockz stores the data (the blocks) in browser's local storage. This means that blocks are only available in your browser but data persists after the browser is closed. 
You can close the browser and return later to continue.

Story Blockz should work online and offline


##Credits
Story Blockz was created by nafergo (animaxionstudioz.com & OpenLab ESEV) to support students in the task of creating scripts for short movies.
