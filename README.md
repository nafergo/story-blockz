#Story Blockz

Story Blockz aims to support people interested in creating linear stories for movies.
Story Blockz stores the data (the blocks) in browser's local storage. This means that blocks are only available in your browser but data persists after the browser is closed. You can close the browser and return later to continue.

Story Blockz should work online and offline

Story Blockz was created by nafergo (animaxionstudioz.com & OpenLab ESEV) to support students in the task of creating linear stories for movies.

It's based on an awesome tutorial by Koes Bong available at http://web.koesbong.com/2011/01/24/sortable-and-editable-to-do-list-using-html5s-localstorage
